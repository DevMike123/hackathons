# GitHub Hackathons

We know there are _lots_ of different types of hackathons. If you'd like to have your hackathon promoted by GitHub, you can submit a request to have your hackathon featured on our [GitHub Events page](https://github.com/events). If you'd like to do this however, your hackathon will need to align to specific criteria. Read on to find out more.

## What is a GitHub Hackathon

GitHub Hackathons are focused on technology solutions usually underpinned by code. Hackathons are focussed on identifying problems and coming up with creative solutions, presenting a proof of concept or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for that solution.

Rather than creating brand new ideas, your hackathon could also be a coding challenge, where you post a problem and developers must use code to solve that problem. The problem could be “build a GitHub Action”, or it could be “solve these issues in this example program”.  Coding challenges are great to learn a new technology space while working together in teams. 

## GitHub Hackathon Criteria

To organize an event that qualifies as an official GitHub Hackathon, these are the things you will need to implement:
- The hackathon projects and ideas MUST be available in a public GitHub repository and published with a recognized open source license. When you create your code repository in GitHub, we help you pick a license or see [choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/) for more information.
- The hackathon MUST enforce a code of conduct to help ensure the event is inclusive and welcoming to all. The type of code of conduct varies depending on if your hackathon is in-person or online. For an in-person event, something like the [GitHub Event Code of Conduct](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-event-code-of-conduct) is a great start. For any open source repo, you’ll need a Code of Conduct, which can be found on the [Contributor Covenant](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-event-code-of-conduct).

If you have questions about the GitHub Hackathon Criteria, please [open an issue]() and we'll try and respond as soon as possible.
