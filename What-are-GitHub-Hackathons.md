## What is a GitHub Hackathon

GitHub Hackathons are focused on technology solutions usually underpinned by code. Hackathons are focussed on identifying problems and coming up with creative solutions, presenting a proof of concept or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for that solution.

Rather than creating brand new ideas, your hackathon could also be a coding challenge, where you post a problem and developers must use code to solve that problem. The problem could be “build a GitHub Action”, or it could be “solve these issues in this example program”.  Coding challenges are great to learn a new technology space while working together in teams.
