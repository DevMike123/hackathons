Is there something you'd like to flag to me. Is there any issues or bugs (probably not many bugs, unless there's a broken link somewhere). Do you have an idea or suggestion? Open an issue and I'll try and respond as soon as I can.

If it's something you think the community can help you with, head to the [Discussions](https://github.com/MishManners/GitHub-Hackathons/discussions) and ask your questions there 😄
