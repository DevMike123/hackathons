Do you have a question regarding the eligibility criteria? Please make your question as detailed as possible.

Please do not open an issue asking for an exemption from one or more of the criteria in order to showcase your hackathon. If your hackathon does not meet the criteria then you are not eligible to feature your hackathon on the GitHub Events site. Consider promoting your hackathon on some of the other sites mentioned in our [Resources](https://github.com/github/hackathon/blob/main/Resources.md) document.
