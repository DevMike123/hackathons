Do you want to add a tip or trick or make a change to the documentation? Head to the [Discussions](https://github.com/github/hackathons/discussions) and ask your questions there ðŸ˜„

If it's something specific you don't want to ask the community, open an issue, but please start with the [Discussions](https://github.com/github/hackathons/discussions) first!

Remember, this repository is designed for hackathon organisers and managers. It is not designed for participants. If your addition or change is not focused on organising or running a hackathon, then your tip/tricks probably won't be added to the documentation.
