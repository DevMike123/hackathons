So you want to run a hackathon? There are a lot of different types of hackathons you can run. Some are simply ideation sessions, others focus on the first stages of solving a problem, and others still are designed to teach people certain concepts, like human-centered design, particular tech stacks like JavaScript, or certain products like GitHub Actions.

## What is a hackathon

Don’t believe the Hollywood movies! In general, a hackathon usually has nothing to do with “breaking into things”. Hacking refers to taking a problem or issue, breaking it down into its root cause, and finding a viable solution.

A hackathon is a short competition where people work together in teams to solve problems and challenges by coming up with solutions and ideas.

We know there are _lots_ of different types of hackathons. If you'd like to have your hackathon promoted by GitHub, you can submit a request to have your hackathon featured on our [GitHub Events page](https://github.com/events). If you'd like to do this however, your hackathon will need to align to specific criteria. Read about the criteria on our [What is a GitHub Hackathon](https://github.com/MishManners/GitHub-Hackathons/blob/main/What-are-GitHub-Hackathons.md) documentation.
