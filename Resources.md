No doubt you’ve now heard about Zoom! It’s essential to use some sort of video conferencing tool when you’re running an offline hackathon with presentations and workshops. Zoom  can be used for organisers to host and kick off a hackathon, as well as having participants dial in and present their ideas at the end. Depending on the format for your hackathon you might decide to limit interaction and leave people to their own devices. If you are interacting with people however, you can’t go past Zoom… just remember to set a password to deter “zoom bombers”!
